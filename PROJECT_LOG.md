# Project log

Every change to this repository is logged here, newest first, in the same commit as the
change, together with the version bump it causes. Rules: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (Versioning).

Entry format:

    ## <version> - <YYYY-MM-DD> - <patch|minor|major>
    - what changed and why (one line each)

## 0.2.1 - 2026-11-03 - patch
- docs/interfaces.md: the API contract for the shared modules (ids, log, config, protocol,
  ssh, redact, safepath), so they can be built in parallel.
- `mulebox/common/` package with the base `MuleboxError`.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-11-03 - minor
- M1.1 package skeleton: `pyproject.toml` (Python 3.12+, setuptools 84.2.1, version read
  from VERSION), `mulebox` CLI entry point with `--version` / `version`, pytest 9.2.0 as the
  pinned dev dependency, tests for the CLI and version source.
- File-size rule enforced in code: `tools/check_line_counts.py` warns above 300 lines and
  fails at 500; the test suite runs it on the whole repository.
- README: development section (venv, install, tests).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-11-03 - minor
- Project created from the design work in a private setup repo: README, design, roadmap
  (docs/phases.md), versioning and project-log rules, agent rules.
- Design reviewed by an external model (core queue, dashboard, multiple machines); the
  adopted changes are part of docs/design.md.
- Groundwork measured on a real setup (M4 Pro laptop vs a 2014 4-core i7 on Wi-Fi): the old
  machine ran two real CI suites 1.8x and 3.5x slower than the laptop, but 2-3x faster than
  GitHub-hosted runners, with the laptop left idle. Basis for "offload, then queue".
