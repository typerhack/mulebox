name: mulebox
description: Run a project's builds, type checks, lint and tests on a build machine through mulebox instead of on this laptop. Use when working in a repository that has a .mulebox.yml, when about to run a build or test command there, when a project's rules mention mulebox, or when asked to set a project up for mulebox.

# mulebox

mulebox runs heavy commands on a Linux build machine through one shared queue. You keep
editing, searching and using git here; builds and tests go through `mulebox`.

## Start here

Run this first, in the project:

    mulebox contract

It prints this project's jobs and commands, what stays local, how git fits in, what is never
uploaded, the exit codes and the rules. It is generated from the project's `.mulebox.yml` and
needs no network. Follow it. It is the source of truth; this skill does not repeat it.

Use `mulebox contract --json` if you want to read it with a tool.

## What to do with it

- **The project has jobs:** run them with the commands the contract lists, instead of the
  project's own build and test commands. Read the job's output as if it ran here; the exit
  code is the job's, or one of the codes the contract explains.
- **It says the project is not set up:** do not set it up unless the user asked. If they
  did, follow section 2 of mulebox's `docs/agents.md`.
- **`mulebox` is not found, or a command exits 3:** stop and tell the user. Never fall back
  to running heavy commands on this machine. That rule matters most: it is what keeps the
  laptop free.

## When something goes wrong

- A job failed: that is a normal result. Read its output and fix the code.
- A job waits in the queue: that is normal too. Other projects and CI share it.
- mulebox itself could not do what you needed: tell the user what happened, with the
  command, the exit code and the job id.
